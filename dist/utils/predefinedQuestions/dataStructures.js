        ],
        explanation: "The time complexity of BFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because BFS needs to visit each vertex and edge at least once."

        ],
        explanation: "B-trees are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, such as disk drives. They reduce the number of disk accesses by having a large number of keys and children in each node, making them better suited for disk access patterns than binary search trees."

            { text: "A* Algorithm", isCorrect: false }
        ],
        explanation: "Dijkstra's Algorithm cannot handle graphs with negative weight edges because it assumes that adding an edge to a path can never decrease the path's length, which is not true when negative weights are allowed."

        ],
        explanation: "A sentinel node (or dummy node) in a linked list is used to simplify edge cases and avoid special case handling, particularly for empty lists or operations at the head or tail of the list. It helps avoid null checks and makes the code cleaner."
